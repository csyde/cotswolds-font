Welcome to the Cotswolds font
=============================

Cotswolds is -- well, was -- an attempt to create a free Cheltenham. The name was meant to be temporary, but it seems that it'll have to stay for now since it's moved away a bit from the Chelt mold. 

The base ASCII set was roughed out with Fontstruct.com. Further edits have been done in FontForge on macOS. Some glyphs *may* have been stolen from other FOSS fonts. (Specifically, a couple came from Google's Roboto, under the Apache License 2.0.)

The font file in this archive was created using: 

* Fontstruct the free, online font-building tool (fontstruct.com) for the basic outlines.
* FontForge (fontforge.github.io) for the tweaky bits and the parts outside the ASCII section, including diacritics and a lot of punctuation.
